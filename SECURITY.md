## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a vulnerability is found that could harm or affect users of the Minehut+ mod, please DO NOT create an issue for it.
Instead, DM on Discord with relevant information like your Minecraft version, your Minehut+ mod version, and steps on how to replicate the vulnerability.

Otherwise, if a bug that only affects your own experience, but cannot remotely affect other users on your command, please create a GitHub issue about it.
